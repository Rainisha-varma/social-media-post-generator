## Overview

This project is a cutting-edge web application that harnesses the power of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI)**, specifically utilizing **Google's Gemini API**, to effortlessly create engaging and tailored social media posts. Say goodbye to writer's block! Whether you need content for Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, or any other platform, and want to control the tone, add emojis, or include hashtags, this tool helps you craft compelling captions and messages in seconds.

The architecture features a minimalist Node.js backend that acts as a secure proxy, taking your input, communicating directly with the Gemini AI model, and returning the generated post to your browser, all while keeping your sensitive API key securely hidden.
